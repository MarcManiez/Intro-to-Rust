# Introduction to Rust

@[joshbuddy](https://github.com/joshbuddy) and @[monokrome](https://github.com/monokrome) teach a weekly devops class at Patreon, and we've taken a bit of a detour into slightly less devops-y subjects.

Since I had been playing around with Rust a little bit, I volunteered to give the class an intro to what I know of Rust.

This is in no way a replacement for [far better resources](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition/). I simply chose some specific aspects of the language and of its compiler that I think makes it stand out, and compared those aspects to C to illustrate why Rust is the way it is and what problems it chose to solve.
